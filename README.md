# TesterUI

The Tester UI subproject for Nl2Bash presents users with potential English/Bash
pairs gathered from sites like StackOverflow from the NL2BashWebScraper component,
asking the user to verify whether each proposed Bash answer does indeed satisfy
the English requirement, or if the English requirement is ill-formed.

The Tester UI project is a Windows Forms application. The easiest way to open this
project is using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 for Windows 10:

    (in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Command Prompt):
    > devenv .\TesterUIFormsApp\TesterUIFormsApp.sln

From this, simply build and run the project in Visual Studio.
