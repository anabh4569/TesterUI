# TesterUI

The Tester UI subproject for Nl2Bash presents users with potential English/Bash
pairs gathered from sites like StackOverflow from the NL2BashWebScraper component,
asking the user to verify whether each proposed Bash answer does indeed satisfy
the English requirement, or if the English requirement is ill-formed.

The Tester UI project is an html/js application. The easiest way to open this
project is html/index.html
